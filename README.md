# Social-Unrest-Political-Chaos
This project asks where social unrest/instability stems from and what processes/situations produce political chaos. It also aims at devising a method to predict social instability right before it escalates into violence/social and political. Further, intends to develop a methodology for risk analysis (investment, travel, personal security). Finally, the files, variables, and scripts represent a work in progress and the findings are preliminary.
